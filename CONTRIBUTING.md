## Code Quality

- **Source Code (`src`)**: Must follow strict TypeScript and Prettier rules, enforced by ESLint with type-aware linting.
- **Test Code (`tests`)**: Must follow Prettier formatting and basic TypeScript rules (e.g., no unused variables). Type-aware linting is disabled for flexibility.
- Run `npm run lint` to check code and `npm run test` to run tests.
- Install the Prettier and ESLint extensions in your editor (e.g., VS Code) to format and lint on save.
